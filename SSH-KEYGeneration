# Generating SSH-KEYS
1. At first we need to create a SSH-key in order to transfer files from our local system 
2. For this we need to use a command 
"ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com""
And after this just press enter and at last we get 2 files one is a private key and other is public key and its location
3. We need to go to that specific location and copy the address of the public key where it is saved as pub extension.
4. Go to Github and settings followed by ssh keys and click on new ssh and paste the address in it.
